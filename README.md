# OceanBase Examples

English | [简体中文](README-CN.md)

## Introduction

This repository provides the sample projects for OceanBase，which are grouped by programming language, and the sample directory is named after the component name.

You can copy the sample code to local environment and use it directly after changing the connection info, please see the README file in the sample directory for more details.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from anyone, thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/oceanbase/ob-samples/graphs/contributors)!

If you want to add a new module, please make sure to place it in the directory of corresponding programming language and name it after the component name.

In the module, make sure to include the following files:

- code files
- `run.sh` script to run code
- `README.md` documentation for component usage.

If it's hard to use English for you, you can use your native language in the documentation and we can improve it later.

To ensure the sample works, please add your module to the GitHub CI workflow, see [ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) for more details.
